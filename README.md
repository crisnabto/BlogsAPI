  <summary><strong>üêã Running on Docker vs Locally</strong></summary><br />
  
  ## On Docker

  > :information_source: Run the `node` service with the command `docker-compose up -d`.
  
  - These services will initialize a container named `blogs_api`.
  
  - From here you can run the `trybers_and_dragons` container via CLI or open it in VS Code..
  
  > :information_source: Use the command `docker exec -it blogs_api bash`.

  - It will give you access to the interactive terminal of the container created by compose, which is running in the background.

  > :information_source:  Install dependencies [**If any**] with `npm install` 
    
  - **‚ö† Attention:** If you choose to use Docker, **ALL** commands available in `package.json` (npm start, npm test, npm run dev, ...) must be executed **INSIDE** the container, i.e., in the terminal that appears after executing the `docker exec` command mentioned above.
